## 📜 About

This project was an attempt to emulate the old MMO *Wakfu Les Gardiens*, a flash-based online game by Ankama.  
It started with passion, nostalgia, and high hopes — and ended with chaos, confusion, and uncommented functions.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- This project is **not maintained**.
- The codebase is **messy**, inconsistent, and possibly haunted.
- It’s not production-ready, not even test-ready.
- Use at your own risk — preferably not at all.

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside

- Random classes with questionable architecture
- Half-working packet parsers
- Probably some hardcoded IPs and magic numbers
- Zero documentation and forgotten TODOs

---

## 🙈 Why This Exists

Mostly for historical purposes or for people curious about how not to write an emulator.  
It might still contain useful bits for brave souls or digital archaeologists.

---

## 💀 Final Words

This emulator project is **officially abandoned**. No updates, no support, no regrets.  
Feel free to fork it, burn it, or dissect it — just don’t expect it to work out of the box.

*Thanks for passing by. Long live nostalgia.*
